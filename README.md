# Robotics Control using Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:
In this repo, I experiment with the real of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to solve robotics control problems. The work spans Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG).
